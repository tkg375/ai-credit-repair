Re: Debt Validation and Dispute — Acct #${accountNumber}, Alleged Balance: ${balanceStr}

To Whom It May Concern:

I am formally disputing the above-referenced account and requesting debt validation pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), 15 U.S.C. § 1692g.

REASON FOR DISPUTE:
${reason}

VALIDATION REQUEST:
Under the FDCPA, please provide: (1) the amount owed and how it was calculated; (2) the name and address of the original creditor; (3) proof you are licensed to collect in my state; (4) a copy of the original signed agreement; (5) complete payment history; (6) proof the statute of limitations has not expired; and (7) proof you own or are authorized to collect this debt.

LEGAL NOTICE:
Until you provide proper validation, you must cease all collection activity, including credit reporting. Under FCRA § 623, reporting information you cannot validate constitutes a violation of federal law.

You have 30 days to respond. If you cannot validate this debt, you must immediately cease collection efforts, remove all negative reporting from Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion, and notify me in writing. Failure to comply may result in complaints to the CFPB, FTC, and my state Attorney General.

Sincerely,

${profile?.fullName || userName}
